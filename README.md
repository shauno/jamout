# NodeJS test

Playing around with node and some of the associated tooling.

So far, trying out:

* NodeJS
* ExpressJS as a framework
* PassportJS for authentication
* MongoDB for persistence
* DotENV for environment based settings
* Bower for front end dependency management
* Gulp for front end task running
* Angular for front end templating
